# Key-Logger
Simple Key-logger implementation used for penetration testing. Good practice in order to understand the underlying functions of key-loggers.

# TYPE OF KEYLOGGER: Software-Based

---

## DESCRIPTION:

```text
This software keylogger is designed to run on the host machine logging keystrokes. The Potential ways to deploy this form of Malware, via USB drive or spoofed webpage.
The first implementation will provide a python script, but the primary learning objective is to do this in a different languages to make this script versitle and more
efficient especially on differnet deployment techniques.
```
## DEPLOYMENT METHODS:

```text
1. Spoofed Webpage Delivery

The first method involves embedding or disguising the keylogger within a spoofed webpage.
This technique simulates how attackers may leverage social engineering or drive-by downloads
to distribute malware.
```
```text
2. USB-Based Auto-Execution

The second method simulates autorun-style malware delivery via a USB device. This method demonstrates how attackers may
exploit physical access or baiting tactics. A Makefile will be used to automate the generation and packaging of
the payload for deployment.
