TYPE OF KEYLOGGER: Software-Based
DESCRIPTION:
This software keylogger is designed to run on a host machine and log keystrokes for educational and research purposes. It demonstrates how user input can be captured via software and explores methods of cross-platform deployment.

The initial implementation is written in Python, but the core learning objective is to extend this concept into other programming languages to enhance performance, portability, and stealth across various environments.

DEPLOYMENT METHODS:
1. Spoofed Webpage Delivery

The first method involves embedding or disguising the keylogger within a spoofed webpage. This technique simulates how attackers may leverage social engineering or drive-by downloads to distribute malware.

2. USB-Based Auto-Execution

The second method simulates autorun-style malware delivery via a USB device. This method demonstrates how attackers may exploit physical access or baiting tactics. A Makefile will be used to automate the generation and packaging of the payload for deployment.

Note on Ethics and Legality:
This project is strictly for educational, ethical hacking, and research purposes only. Unauthorized deployment or use of this tool without informed consent is illegal and unethical.
